# CA Thomas Fire Impact on AQI
This repository contains an analysis of the Thomas Fire, including a raster image with the fire's perimeter and plots depicting the air quality (AQI) in affected counties.

## Background
The Thomas Fire began late December (2017) in Ventura County and continued to affect both Santa Barbara and Ventura counties into the new year. This analysis uses raster data to produce a map of the fire's perimeter. Additionally, a simple visualization was created to demonstrated the severity of the Thomas Fire's affect on air quality (AQI) in both counties.
